- ## **Description**
This task management app offers users an easy and efficient way to organize their tasks. Users can quickly add, edit, or delete tasks, helping them stay organized and track their progress. Each task displays key details such as a title and an optional due date, ensuring clarity and focus.

To improve user experience, the app allows filtering tasks by status (e.g., active, completed), enabling users to concentrate on what matters most.

**Various HTTP Requests:** The app integrates multiple types of HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to interact with the server, enabling dynamic task management, such as retrieving, updating, or deleting tasks.
<br>

**Asynchronous Operations:** Efficiently handles asynchronous operations using then, catch, and finally, ensuring smooth user experience when fetching or updating data without blocking the user interface.

<br>

**Sorting:** The app supports sorting tasks by their status, allowing users to quickly find the tasks they need.
<br>

**Reusable Components:** Built with modular React components that can be reused throughout the app, reducing code duplication and improving maintainability.
<br>

**Smooth Animations:** Includes animations for actions such as adding or removing tasks, enhancing the overall user experience.
